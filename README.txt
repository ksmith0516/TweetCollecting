Excuting the program will collect 100,000 tweets using my Twitter account for the following topics: sports, TV, movies, politics. All tweets are stored in a file, each on its own line. Once completed, the hashtags are extracted and stored in their own file. If the tweet file already exists, then tweet collection is bypassed. Additionally, if the hashtag file exists, that is bypassed.

All filenames and Twitter keys are hardcoded. If the application were to evolve and allow users to user their own account and preferences, then user prompts for filenames, Twitter keys, and categories could be implemented.
